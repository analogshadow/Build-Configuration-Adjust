/* This is the "single file distribution" (sfd) version of Build Configuration
   Adjust (BCA). It is contracted by a Makefile target in the standard source
   tree, by concatenating a subset of the source files together. The purpose is
   to have a single file that can be placed in source tarballs so that an end
   user does not need to have the full BCA installed. Generally this version is
   able to be compiled with a single invocation of cc (gcc/clang) via
   configure.sh. There are many reasons this may not work such as limited RAM
   available to the compiler on older or embedded systems.

   In such cases, the best chance of success is to build BCA from source on a
   different computer, copy the Makefile to the one unable to build this file
   along with the rest of the source tree, and try "make native/bca".
